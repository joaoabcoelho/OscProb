# OscProb  {#index}

OscProb is a small set of classes aimed at computing exact neutrino oscillation probabilities with a few different models.

OscProb contains a basic framework for computing neutrino oscillation probabilities. It is integrated into [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/), so that each class can be used as you would any ROOT class.

Available classes are:
- **[PremModel](@ref OscProb::PremModel):** Used for determining neutrino paths through the earth
- **[PMNS_Fast](@ref OscProb::PMNS_Fast):** Standard 3-flavour oscillations
- **[PMNS_Sterile](@ref OscProb::PMNS_Sterile):** Oscillations with any number of neutrinos
- **[PMNS_NSI](@ref OscProb::PMNS_NSI):** Oscillations with 3 flavours including Non-Standard Interactions
- **[PMNS_Deco](@ref OscProb::PMNS_Deco):** Oscillations with 3 flavours including a simple decoherence model
- **[PMNS_LIV](@ref OscProb::PMNS_LIV):** Oscillations with 3 flavours including Lorentz Invariance Violations
- **[PMNS_Decay](@ref OscProb::PMNS_Decay):** Oscillations with 3 flavours including neutrino decays of the second and third neutrino mass states nu_2 and nu_3. [Requires external library Eigen3, see the instructions below.]

A few example macros on how to use OscProb are available in a tutorial directory.

# Installing OscProb

OscProb is very easy to install. The only requirements is to have ROOT installed with the GSL libraries.

**NEW: Thanks to Jacek Holeczek, OscProb now also builds with ROOT 6!!**

In order to compile the [PMNS_Decay](@ref OscProb::PMNS_Decay) class, it is necessary to donwload the external Eigen library. This library is added as a submodule. There are two options:
- During cloning: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/joaoabcoelho/OscProb.git`
- After clonning: `git submodule update --init`

Once you have ROOT setup, simply do:
```sh
cd OscProb
make
```

A shared library will be produced: ```libOscProb.so```

This should take a few seconds and you are all set.

Just load the shared library in your ROOT macros with:
```cpp
gSystem->Load("/full/path/to/libOscProb.so");
```

Or use the ```LoadOscProb.C``` macro (see below).

# Tutorial

In the directory OscProb/tutorial you will find a few macros with examples using OscProb.

Two macros are particularly useful:
- ```simpleExamples.C``` : Contains some short pieces of code on how to perform different tasks.
- ```MakeOscillogram.C``` : Runs a full example of how to plot an oscillogram with the PREM model.

Additionally, these macros contain useful tools:
- ```LoadOscProb.C```: Searches for the OscProb library in your current directory, parent directory, or library path, and then loads it. It is called within the tutorial macros as a possible usage example.
- ```SetNiceStyle.C```: Provides simple tools to make your plots look nicer. Feel free to use it anytime you're making plots, even if you're not running OscProb. This is completely independent of OscProb.

To run macros in compiled mode you will need to preload the OscProb library, e.g:

```sh
root -l LoadOscProb.C MakeOscillogram.C+
```
